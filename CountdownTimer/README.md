### Once the timer has started, the input fields should be replaced with plain text that updates every second. The 'Start' button should be replaced with 'Pause' and 'Reset' buttons.

### Once the timer completes, it should alert the user with a native notification (using the Notification API), or fallback to an alert.

## Requirements
‚Ä¢ The 'Hours', 'Minutes', and 'Seconds' fields should not have visible labels, but they should be accessible and clearly labelled to a screen reader.\
‚Ä¢ The input fields should use placeholder text as shown in the screenshot above.\
‚Ä¢ Pressing 'Start' should start the timer, replace the input fields with plain text for the hours/minutes/seconds, and replace 'Start' with 'Pause' and 'Reset' buttons.\
‚Ä¢ Pressing 'Pause' should pause the timer, and replace the 'Pause' button with a 'Start' button.\
‚Ä¢ Pressing 'Reset' should revert the app back to the initial state.\
‚Ä¢ While the timer is counting down, the numbers should be zero-padded (e.g. 01 vs 1).\
‚Ä¢ When the timer reaches zero, if the app has appropriate permissions, it should display a Notification that the timer is complete.\
‚Ä¢ If the app doesn't have appropriate permissions, it should show an alert when the timer reaches zero.
